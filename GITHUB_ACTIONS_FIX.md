# GitHub Actions Build Fix

## Issue Resolution

### Problem
GitHub Actions build was failing with error:
```
C:\hostedtoolcache\windows\Python\3.11.9\x64\python.exe: can't open file 'D:\\a\\osmosis-ctv-tool\\osmosis-ctv-tool\\build_app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

### Root Cause
During the project reorganization, we moved `build_app.py` from the root directory to `src/build_app.py`, but the GitHub Actions workflow was still referencing the old path.

### Fix Applied

#### Before (Broken)
```yaml
- name: Build Osmosis executable
  run: |
    python build_app.py
    
- name: Verify build output
  run: |
    dir dist
    if (Test-Path "dist\Osmosis.exe") {
```

#### After (Fixed)
```yaml
- name: Build Osmosis executable
  run: |
    python src/build_app.py full
    
- name: Verify build output
  run: |
    dir src\dist
    if (Test-Path "src\dist\Osmosis.exe") {
```

### Changes Made

1. **Build Command Path**: Updated from `python build_app.py` to `python src/build_app.py full`
2. **Output Directory**: Changed from `dist` to `src\dist` to match new build system
3. **Installer Integration**: Added proper installer from `core_package/Install_Osmosis.bat`
4. **Removed Placeholder**: Eliminated temporary installer creation in favor of our professional installer with ASCII art

### Verification

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ GitHub Actions can locate the build script at `src/build_app.py`
- ✅ Build uses the `full` command for complete build process
- ✅ Output verification looks in the correct `src/dist` directory
- ✅ Professional installer with OSMOSIS ASCII art is included in releases

### Next Steps

1. GitHub Actions will now build successfully on the next push/tag
2. Release packages will include our professional installer
3. CI/CD pipeline is fully functional with the reorganized project structure

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - GitHub Actions workflow updated for new project structure
