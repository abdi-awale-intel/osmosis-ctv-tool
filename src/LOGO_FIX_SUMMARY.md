# Osmosis CTV Tool - Logo and Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Logos in Deployed Build
**Problem**: The application was using hardcoded paths to logo files:
- `C:\Users\abdiawal\Downloads\logo.jpeg` (application icon)
- `C:\Users\abdiawal\Downloads\lightmode-logo.jpg` (light mode theme)
- `C:\Users\abdiawal\Downloads\darkmode-logo.png` (dark mode theme)

**Solution**:
- Created `src/images/` directory
- Copied all logo files to the project structure
- Updated `ctvlist_gui.py` to use relative paths with `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "images", filename)`
- Modified `osmosis.spec` to bundle the images directory with PyInstaller

### 2. Cross-User Deployment Compatibility
**Problem**: Hardcoded paths prevented the application from working on other users' machines

**Solution**:
- All paths now use relative references from the script location
- Images are bundled within the executable for standalone deployment
- No dependencies on specific user directories

## Files Modified

### `src/ctvlist_gui.py`
- Updated icon loading code to use relative path
- Updated theme logo loading to use relative paths
- Added proper path resolution with `os.path.dirname(__file__)`

### `src/osmosis.spec`
- Added images directory to PyInstaller data files
- Ensures all logos are bundled with the executable

### New Files Added
- `src/images/logo.jpeg` - Application icon (1024x1024)
- `src/images/lightmode-logo.jpg` - Light mode theme logo (758x755)
- `src/images/darkmode-logo.png` - Dark mode theme logo (706x736)
- `src/test_images.py` - Validation script for image loading
